# BootstrapTableau

Bootstrap 5 style extension for Tableau. Create rich backgrounds for Tableau objects using only class names.

## Usage

Bootstrap Tableau works in a similar manner to background images. The difference is you use Tableau objects as your anchor for backgrounds.

Download the .trex file [here](https://github.com/FsuLauncherComp/BootstrapTableau/blob/main/tabcss.trex).

1. Float the Extension onto the Dashboard and set it to the size of the dashboard.
2. Design your Dashboard by placing your objects (worksheets, text, etc) on top of the Extension
3. Change the name of the Object in the item hierarchy
4. Pattern: Object Name|Bootstrap 5 Classes

## Just use some words

The Extension levarages a unique idea: Create a blank html canvas, create objects with the same location and size as the Tableau Objects, style them using Bootstrap. 

There is no configuration popup, no JSON configs, just pure Bootstrap CSS
